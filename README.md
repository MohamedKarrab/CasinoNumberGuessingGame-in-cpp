# CasinoNumberGuessingGame

Hey there, this is a nice beginner project for a simple number guessing game. 
Here I used a good random number generator, which is way better than using rand() function.

The Game Rules are :
1) Your Goal is to reach 10000$ to win! ;
2) if you guess right, you get x10 times the amount you bet with ;
3) If you guess wrong, you lose all the money you bet with ;
